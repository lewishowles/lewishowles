## Hi, I'm Lewis ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate, versatile UI/UX Developer and Designer, with over 15 years experience spanning UI Design, Front-end Development, Web Design, Graphic Design, Accessibility and, historically, Backend Development.

Iâ€™m enthusiastic about improving the userâ€™s experience, the developerâ€™s experience, and making websites and apps that are not only beautiful and powerful, but also easy to use and accessible. My passion for inclusive design fuels my drive to craft delightful user experiences.
